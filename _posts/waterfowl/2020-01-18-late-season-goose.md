### Cold &amp; Windy

One of the coldest days of the year and the wind pushed the chill down even lower. The wind was fairly consistent from 3 to 5 miles per hour but the gusts were in the mid teens and when they came from the northeast they would cut across the blind and any exposed skin. Most of the waters on the surrounding properties were frozen over leaving the river one of the only viable options for waterfowl.

### Dry Blind

With the hard freeze plus a lower river level the bottom of the blind was void of any water making it more comfortable. This seems to be common in the late season.

### Birds Flying

The birds started moving later in the morning once the sun was up a bit–sometime between 9am and 10am we started seeing a lot of activity. Most of the geese flocks were moving high and fast and didn't seem eager to respond to calls or come into the decoys. We did get a pair to come in and land inside of the decoys. Both were finished, it was picture perfect.

### Something To Note

We spooked the most birds we've ever seen roosting near the blind during our entry. We made it within 20 yards of the blind on the back side when the spooked (fairly certain they saw our silhouettes). The blacked out the morning sky, must've been close to 200. With all of the commotion there were still a group of geese in the roost that came swimming in to our outer zone before taking flight to join a flock moving in the air behind us.
