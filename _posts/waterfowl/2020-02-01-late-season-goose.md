### The Fowl Hunt You Don't Want
Not a single damn bird was seen nor heard (well, once way off in the distance, barely audible). Little to any wind at all, mostly a calm and still day. No movement around us. Not at all ideal for waterfowling in our neck of the woods.

### Rare Warmth
It's been an odd, warmer winter here in Massachusetts, and a warmer late season has proven to be detrimental to our particular location. There's a lot of open still water; bogs and resevoirs. In the late season these are frozen over and the only water available is the river on which our blind sits. This usually means a productive late season, with 2 weekends left I don't think that will apply to this year.
