### The Hunt You Don't Want
Not a single damn bird was seen nor heard (well once way off in the distance, barely audible). Little to any wind at all, mostly a calm and still day. No movement around us.

### Rare Warmth
It's been an odd, warmer winter here in Massachusetts, and a warmer late season has proven to be detrimental to our particular location.
