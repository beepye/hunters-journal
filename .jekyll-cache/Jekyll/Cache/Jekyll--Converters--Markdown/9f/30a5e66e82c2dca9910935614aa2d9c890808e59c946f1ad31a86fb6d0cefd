<h2 id="eastern-wind">Eastern Wind</h2>
<p>It was different hunting an eastern wind in our blind, usually we have westerly winds allowing the blind to shield us a bit from the late season cold. The advantage to the eastern wind is on a sunny morning the birds approach to land from the west keeping the sun from our eyes (though today was overcast and gray).</p>

<p>It’s been an unusually warmer January this year and it’s only dipped below freezing on occasion. The area we hunt is most productive when the surrounding open waters are frozen thus “forcing” the birds to look for accommodation on the shallows of the river we have our blind on. There was a hard freeze last week that has slowly been thawing, fortunately this morning most still waters had a thin sheet of ice on them still.</p>

<h2 id="bird-movement">Bird Movement</h2>
<p>Lots of bird movement around noon that followed through until close to 2. Mostly all geese moving in V’s to and from though they seemed to generally move along with the eastern winds.</p>

<p>Couldn’t get birds to finish; on several occasions a flock would fly in and circle low over the decoys but never finish or come back for another pass (and for once we didn’t take passing shots but rather remained patient for the birds to land). I don’t think we were spotted though it’s hard to say, but they didn’t seem to like something, maybe the decoy setup? The only exception was a lone goose that was called in and finished 10yds from the decoys, he turned out to be the only goose of the day.</p>

<h2 id="decoy-placement">Decoy Placement</h2>
<p>The decoys may have been too tightly packed given that it was a warmer day–should we have spread them out more? Also the wind was variable and not at all steady so there were times where they looked “dead in the water”. We had them placed roughly 40 yards off to our right (east) with the intent to have the birds finish in front of them. With there being a different wind than usual I wonder if the decoy location should have been different?</p>
