<p>Or it could be a hunterâ€™s hell where the bucks are there, theyâ€™re mature, â€œoutside the earsâ€, but theyâ€™re also ghosts moving in a nocturnal nature due to the potential pressureâ€¦ Iâ€™ve got trail cam images of several â€œshooterâ€ bucks. One of them Iâ€™ve already nicknamed Ghost; Iâ€™ve only got 1 day time photo of him and the rest are all late night and the way he enters the frame is very phantom like. He looks to be the dominant buck, big body and a wide sitting rack. Thereâ€™s another 8 point and what is either a 6 or 8 that both seem to be on the mature cusp, weâ€™ll see what they look like next year.</p>

<p>But Iâ€™m not sure if the pressure really <em>is</em> there, aside from shotgun season, to cause much of a problem. I can definitely tell late season will be toughâ€“directly because of shotgun seasonâ€“and if I donâ€™t find the bedding and a way to hunt it late season may be a bust here. Iâ€™m hoping thatâ€™s not the case.</p>

<h3 id="so-much-sign">So Much Sign</h3>

<p>Seriously, so much. Like itâ€™s <em>almost</em> ridiculous â€¦ almost. Within the last decade there was some *clear-cutting done which left a lot of logging roads behind. The logging roads have scrapes and rubs in abundance and some are clearly high-traffic deer runs. The roads have since filled in with low growth like pine saplings and scrub oaks. The pines are providing excellent cover and giving the deer a lot of opportunity to roam without exposing themselves to much. Different parts of the property have areas that are extremely thick pine cover and in the middle of these are small clearings with loads of sign. The oaks left behind from the clear cuts are large and mature and are interspersed within the pines. Wherever thereâ€™s a big oak thereâ€™s sign of feeding and in some areas bedding.</p>

<h3 id="terrain-variety">Terrain Variety</h3>

<p>Everything you could want in one 300 acre area! Hills galore, some are steep sloped and others gradual. Thereâ€™s 2 ridges running north to south (roughly) and in between is a ravine with a creek cutting through it. The western ridge has power lines running across it. The power lines push up against an old pine forest that backs up to a marsh (I havenâ€™t checked this area out yet but I will). The eastern ridge has some hard angled slopes making it work to get up (good thing). Itâ€™s covered in pitch pine with oaks here and there. The woods are a little more open which makes me think itâ€™s not an active spot during hunting hours, but itâ€™s definitely a feeding area late night.</p>
