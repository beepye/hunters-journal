<p>Or it could be a hunterâ€™s hell where the bucks are there, theyâ€™re mature, â€œoutside the earsâ€, but theyâ€™re also ghosts moving in a nocturnal nature due to the potential pressureâ€¦</p>

<p>But Iâ€™m not sure if the pressure really <em>is</em> there, aside from shotgun season, to cause much of a problem. I can definitely tell late season will be toughâ€“directly because of shotgun seasonâ€“and if I donâ€™t find the bedding and a way to hunt it late season may be a bust here. Iâ€™m hoping thatâ€™s not the case.</p>

<p>Seriously, so much. Like itâ€™s <em>almost</em> ridiculous â€¦ almost.</p>
